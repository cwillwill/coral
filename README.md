# Coral

_Description_:  "Coral" is a wooden, electronic, memory audio game for the visually impaired. Housed within a laser-engraved wooden enclosure, the electronics of this toy produce tonal sequences to be matched. A player's responses are identified by toy rotation in four directions. The highly textured exterior and the stylized marker provide tactile orientation cues. Game states are distinguished by families of distinctive auditory cues. This project explored diverse disciplines: sound design, product design, interaction design, user interface design, and architecture.
